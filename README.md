> ScrollMagic for wizards

### Why, oh why would you do this?!

ScrollMagic is amazing but it's a legacy behemouth which, apparently, has been abandoned. I decided to wave the babel/rollup wand over the code (well, the bits I use) to enable simpler usage within in a "modern" environment.

### Future

- [ ] Lodash all the things
- [ ] Separate features (again) into ES6 classes
- [ ] Port documentation

### License
